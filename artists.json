At the time, she was known as B2K member Lil' Fizz's \"cousin\", though she is not actually related to him.

In 2003, Aiko was set to release her debut album, My Name Is Jhen√©, through her labels Sony, The Ultimate Group and Epic, however the album was never released, with Aiko asking to be released from the label in order to continue her education. In March 2011, Aiko made her return to music with the release of her first full-length project, a mixtape titled Sailing Soul(s). On December 16, 2011, Aiko signed a recording contract with American record producer No I.D.'s record label Artium, distributed through Def Jam Recordings. In 2013, Aiko appeared on Big Sean's single \"Beware\", also featuring Lil Wayne, which became her first top 40 hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The EP was supported by the singles \"3:16AM\", \"Bed Peace\" and \"The Worst\", the latter of which went on to become certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Aiko released her major-label debut album, Souled Out, on September 9, 2014.",
